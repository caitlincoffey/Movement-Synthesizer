# About The Project



1. Motivation/context
2. What the reader needs to know to understand the paper
3. What this paper will do

Thoughts from the lecture:
- Do MLA citations and have perhaps a separate references page. 
- [1] inline citations, whenever you're taking information from a reference you should use it. Note that inline citations should be at the end of the sentence, like this [1].
- How to make equations: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26275645/how-to-support-latex-in-github-pages)
- For graphs, choose distinguishing colors, different line thicknesses.

Value Creation
The proof-of-concept supports a specific user group(s) in clearly defined ways. The connection between the proof-of-concept and the user group is clear, and based on existing research and/or a strong understanding of particular areas of opportunity.
	
This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Motion Model
Your motion model should demonstrated a clear understanding of the dynamics of your motion, the degrees of freedom and their time derivatives, and the important frequencies. You should explain how your model informed your data collection, and what, if any, modifications were made to the model following experimentation.
	
This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Proof-of-Concept
The proof-of-concept should include a selection of sensors that are appropriate for the specific application. The experiment(s) should demonstrate some aspect of how the product would work in reality. Next steps for the proof-of-concept (e.g. additional experiments, changes to the design) should be well articulated.
	
This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Algorithm Development
The algorithm(s) for data analysis should demonstrate a clear understanding of Fourier analysis, frequency and time domains, and motion model dynamics. The project website should clearly explain the application of the algorithm to the experimental data through the use of appropriate equations and graphics.
	
This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Overall Presentation and Delivery of Information
The website is professional and well-organized. The information is clear, easy to understand, and appropriate for the intended audience.


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/caitlincoffey/discrete/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
