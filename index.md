# About The Project

Imagine having a new musical instrument from your phone that encourages movement, different dance moves, and a love for experimentation. Our project idea aims to fill this potential hole in people’s lives by taking accelerometer data from a smartphone and manipulating these incoming signals to produce vibrant, unique music relative to the person's movement.

## Why Create Music from Movement?

For people who are indoors most or all of the day (either working at home or isolating), one might have heard of the term 'Quarantine Fatigue'. Quarantine fatigue is caused by a reduction in physical activity which affects one's mind \[[1](/references)\]. According to the American Heart Association even small bursts of movement are beneficial to one’s health \[[2](/references)\]. By having the collection of the information be tied to a smartphone, it allows flexibility on the user’s behalf. End users can collect the data while running, walking, or even standing. 

In addition, even if the music isn’t a Mozart worthy masterpiece, having a low level of background music can help boost creativity in one’s endeavors \[[3](/references)\]. According to the Harvard Medical School, “usic can enhance the function of neural networks, slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure, and reduce levels of stress hormones, appealing to end users who might be stressed due to their environment or other factors \[[4](/references)\]. 

Inspired by the benefits of both these exercises, our project combines them into an easily accessible smartphone program targetted towards people who are spending more time than usual indoors and sitting down (e.g. students, remote workers).

## How it Works
- Talk about motion model 
- Talk about sensors 
### Explaining 'The Black Box'
- Explain Fourier Analysis 
To help demystify the process of the way our project creates music from accelerometer data, we will walk through our algorithms step-by-step to ensure transparency:

<!--- Thoughts from the lecture:
- Do MLA citations and have perhaps a separate references page. 
- [1] inline citations, whenever you're taking information from a reference you should use it. Note that inline citations should be at the end of the sentence, like this [1].
- How to make equations: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26275645/how-to-support-latex-in-github-pages)
- For graphs, choose distinguishing colors, different line thicknesses.

Value Creation
The proof-of-concept supports a specific user group(s) in clearly defined ways. The connection between the proof-of-concept and the user group is clear, and based on existing research and/or a strong understanding of particular areas of opportunity.
This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Motion Model
Your motion model should demonstrated a clear understanding of the dynamics of your motion, the degrees of freedom and their time derivatives, and the important frequencies. You should explain how your model informed your data collection, and what, if any, modifications were made to the model following experimentation.
This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Proof-of-Concept
The proof-of-concept should include a selection of sensors that are appropriate for the specific application. The experiment(s) should demonstrate some aspect of how the product would work in reality. Next steps for the proof-of-concept (e.g. additional experiments, changes to the design) should be well articulated.
This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Algorithm Development
The algorithm(s) for data analysis should demonstrate a clear understanding of Fourier analysis, frequency and time domains, and motion model dynamics. The project website should clearly explain the application of the algorithm to the experimental data through the use of appropriate equations and graphics.
This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Overall Presentation and Delivery of Information
The website is professional and well-organized. The information is clear, easy to understand, and appropriate for the intended audience.
