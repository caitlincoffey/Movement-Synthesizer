## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/caitlincoffey/discrete/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Latex?

Thoughts from the lecture:
- Do MLA citations and have perhaps a separate references page. 
- [1] inline citations, whenever you're taking information from a reference you should use it. Note that inline citations should be at the end of the sentence, like this [1].
- How to make equations: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26275645/how-to-support-latex-in-github-pages)
- For graphs, choose distinguishing colors, different line thicknesses.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/caitlincoffey/discrete/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
